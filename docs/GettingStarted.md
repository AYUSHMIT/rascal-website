**Synopsis.**

First steps using Rascal

**Description.**

You can start using Rascal by following these steps:

  - **Download and Install** Rascal by carefully following the instructions at the [Rascal
    Website](http://www.rascal-mpl.org/start/).

> **Caution**
> 
> Please respect the recommended versions of Java (JDK) and Eclipse (Eclipse for RCP Developers). In case of
> installation problems you can consult the [trouble shooting](http://www.rascal-mpl.org/help/troubleshooting.html) page
> or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rascal).

  - **Start** Rascal. The Rascal system comes in two flavours: a command line version and a version integrated in
    Eclipse.

At the command line the Rascal system can be invoked by typing the command `rascal`. Next, the Rascal prompt `rascal>`
appears and you can start typing commands (declarations, statements, expressions). To simplify interactive use,
semicolons (`;`) that end commands may be omitted at the top level.

> **Note**
> 
> `rascal` command is not yet standard installed

In the Eclipse version, Rascal modules can be edited and a command console is also available.
