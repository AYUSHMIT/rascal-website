title: Statement as Expression
---

#### Synopsis

Some statements that have a value and can be used as expressions.

#### Description

Several forms of statements produce a value and can be used as expression. 
This is further explained in the sections for the relevant statements, see [If](../../../Rascal/Statements/If/index.md), [While](../../../Rascal/Statements/While/index.md), [Do](../../../Rascal/Statements/Do/index.md), [For](../../../Rascal/Statements/For/index.md), and [Visit](../../../Rascal/Expressions/Visit/index.md).

#### Pitfalls

* It is likely that the design of Rascal will evolve into completely merging expressions and statements.
