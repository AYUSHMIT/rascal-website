#### Synopsis

Reference manual for the Rascal meta-programming language. 

#### Syntax

#### Types

#### Function

#### Description

Here we describe _all_ features of the Rascal language in detail, for reference purposes.

* [Declarations](/docs//Rascal/Declarations)
* [Patterns](/docs//Rascal/Patterns)
* [Expressions](/docs//Rascal/Expressions)
* [Statements](/docs//Rascal/Statements)

You can find more (accessible) information related to Rascal here:

*  [Why Rascal](/docs//WhyRascal/): gives the motivation for the Rascal language and describes various usage scenarios.
*  [Getting Started](/docs//GettingStarted/) describes how to download, install and start Rascal.
*  [Getting Help](/docs//GettingHelp/) shows how to use the help facilties and search the documentation. 
   See [Further Reading][Getting help:Further reading](/docs//GettingHelp/FurtherReading) for a reading guide.
*  Library functies are described in [Rascal Libraries](/docs//Library/lang/rascal/tutor/examples/Test/Libraries).
*  We do not maintain a list of frequently asked questions (faq) but 
   use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rascal) instead.

#### Examples

*  We show examples for each Rascal language construct described here.
*  You can find many simple code examples in [Recipes](/docs//Recipes/). 
*  The [Rascal Libraries](/docs//Library/lang/rascal/tutor/examples/Test/Libraries) contain examples for most functions. 

#### Benefits

*  Rascal has everything you need for any kind of (meta-)program you want to write. See [Why Rascal](/docs//WhyRascal/).

#### Pitfalls

*  Rascal is a procedural/functional language with immutable data. Do not confuse this with object-oriented programming.
*  Rascal allows you to write highly imperative code, but it has declarative constructs that lead to shorter and more readable code.
