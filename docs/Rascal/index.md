#### Synopsis

Reference manual for the Rascal meta-programming language. 

#### Description

Here we describe _all_ features of the Rascal language in detail, for reference purposes.

* [Declarations](../Rascal/Declarations/index.md)
* [Patterns](../Rascal/Patterns/index.md)
* [Expressions](../Rascal/Expressions/index.md)
* [Statements](../Rascal/Statements/index.md)

You can find more (accessible) information about programming in Rascal here:

*  [Why Rascal](../WhyRascal/index.md): gives the motivation for the Rascal language and describes various usage scenarios.
*  [Getting Started](../GettingStarted/index.md) describes how to download, install and start Rascal. 
*  [Getting Help](../GettingHelp/index.md) shows how to use the help facilties and search the documentation. 
*  See [Further Reading](../GettingHelp/FurtherReading/index.md) for a reading guide to the documentation.
*  Library functies are described in [Rascal Libraries](../Library/index.md).
*  We do not maintain a long list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) but 
   use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rascal) instead.


#### Examples

*  We show examples for each Rascal language construct described here.
*  You can find many simple code examples in [Recipes](../Recipes/index.md). 
*  The [Rascal Libraries](../Library/lang/rascal/tutor/examples/Test/Libraries/index.md) contain examples for most functions. 

#### Benefits

*  Rascal has everything you need for any kind of (meta-)program you want to write. See [Why Rascal](../WhyRascal/index.md).

#### Pitfalls

*  Rascal is a procedural/functional language with immutable data. Do not confuse this with object-oriented programming.
*  Rascal allows you to write highly imperative code, but it has declarative constructs that lead to shorter and more readable code.
