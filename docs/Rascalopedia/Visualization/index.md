Visual presentation of scientific or abstract data.

#### Description

Visualization is the activity of presenting scientific data or abstract structures
in a visual form. There are several subareas:

*  [Scientific visualization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_visualization): deals with data that are geometric in nature and
  may have a time dimension.
*  [Information visualization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_visualization)(: deals with abstract data structures like trees, graphs and relations.
* [Software Visualization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_visualization): deals with facts related to software.
