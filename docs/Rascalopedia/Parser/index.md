#### Synopsis

Check that a text adheres to the rules of a language (and return a [ParseTree](../../Rascalopedia/ParseTree)).

#### Description

A [parser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) checks that a text in language _L_ indeed adheres 
to the syntax rules of language _L_. There are two possible answers:

*  _Yes_. A [ParseTree](../../Rascalopedia/ParseTree) is returned that shows how the text adheres to the syntax rules.
*  _No_. Error messages pin point the location where the text deviates from the syntax rules.

This is shown below:
