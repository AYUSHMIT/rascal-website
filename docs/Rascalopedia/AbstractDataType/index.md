#### Synopsis

A definition of a data type.

#### Description

An [Abstract Data Type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) is a mathematical description of a structure
that can be implemented in various ways. For instance, a stack data type can be characterized by `empty` (the empty stack),
two functions `push` and `pop` and axioms that define them. At the implementation level, a stack
can be implemented using a list, array or something else.

In functional languages, and also in Rascal, abstract datatypes (or ADTs for short)
are used to define new data types. Well-known examples are http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data_structure)[stack] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)[tree].

See [Algebraic Data Types](../../Rascal/Declarations/AlgebraicDataType) and 
[Constructors](../../Rascal/Expressions/Values/Constructor) in the [Rascal Language Reference](../../Rascal/).

## Abstract Data Types in computer science

*  The run-time stack of a programming language interpreter.
*  A search tree.
*  An ontology.


## Abstract Data Types in Rascal

*  A tree data type:
```rascal
data MyTree = leaf(int n) | tree(str name, MyTree left, MyTree right);
```
