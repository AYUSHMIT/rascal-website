#### Description

We discuss several versions of Exp based on concrete syntax:

*  [No Layout](../../../../Recipes/Languages/Exp/Concrete/NoLayout/): is the simplest version that does not consider layout symbols in expressions.
*  [With Layout](../../../../Recipes/Languages/Exp/Concrete/WithLayout/): adds layout information to Exp's synax definition.
