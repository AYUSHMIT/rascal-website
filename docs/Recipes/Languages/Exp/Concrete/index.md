#### Synopsis

Various versions of Exp based on concrete syntax.

#### Description

We discuss several versions of Exp based on concrete syntax:

*  [./No Layout](../../../../Recipes/Languages/Exp/Concrete/NoLayout/index.md): is the simplest version that does not consider layout symbols in expressions.
*  [./With Layout](../../../../Recipes/Languages/Exp/Concrete/WithLayout/index.md): adds layout information to Exp's synax definition.
