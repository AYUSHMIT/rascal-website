#### Synopsis

Some basic, _hello world_-like, examples of Rascal programs.

#### Description

We discuss the following examples:
* [Hello](../../Recipes/Basic/Hello/index.md)
* [Factorial](../../Recipes/Basic/Factorial/index.md)
* [Squares](../../Recipes/Basic/Squares/index.md)
* [Even](../../Recipes/Basic/Even/index.md)
* [Bubble](../../Recipes/Basic/Bubble/index.md)
* [bottles of beer](../../Recipes/Basic/BottlesOfBeer/index.md)
* [fizz buzz](../../Recipes/Basic/FizzBuzz/index.md)
* [Quine](../../Recipes/Basic/Quine/index.md)


#### Pitfalls

These programs illustrate various features of Rascal; they are *not representative* as use cases of the language.
