#### Description

The RascalTutor is an interactive [Authoring](/Tutor/Authoring) and learning environment intended to create and follow interactive courses related to the Rascal language.
It is based on the following principles and ideas:

* The basic notion is a [Concept](/Tutor/Concept). Each concept has a _name_ and contains a fixed set of subsections that describe it.
* A course is a _concept tree_:
  The central subject of the course is the root of the concept tree, and all subtrees further explain their parent concept.
* A Rascal code module is a concept as well. The declarations it contains are not sub-concepts but rather sub-sections of that concept.
* A folder with Rascal modules is also a concept. If it has an `index.md` file this is used to document it, otherwise an `index.md` file is generated.

A _student_ using a course can:

* Browse through the table of contents of the concept tree of the course.
* Search for concepts and specific terms using a search box.
* Read individual concepts.
* Follow links to other concepts.

An _author_ of a course can:

* Create a new course.
* Create a new concept in a course.
* Edit a concept directly using a standard text editor.
* Add code examples that are actually executed at "compile time" of the course. The code examples either simulate the interaction with the Rascal REPL, or they are just highlighted code.
* Recompile the course.
* Inspect the warnings that are generated for the whole course in order to 
  control the quality of the concept descriptions.
* Create links between concepts (in different courses)
* Inline images in the same folder/directory as the concept
* USe Rascal code to create (static) visuals

:::caution
There is a "TODO" in the documentation source:
msg
  (((TODO:fix asciidoctor ref)))
:::
The actual markup used is an extension of Docusaurus, see https://docusaurus.io/ and
in most cases we directly refer to 

* https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features for the "commonmark" compliant features of Docusaurus
* https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react for the MDX/React extensibility features of Docusaurus
