title: Reference to Concept
---

#### Synopsis

Refer to a concept in this course or another course.

#### Syntax

``````
* `(( DisplayName ))`
* `(( ParentConceptName-ConceptName ))`
* `\[LinkText]((Course))`
* `\[LinkText]((Course:ParentConceptName-ConceptName))`
``````

#### Types

#### Function

#### Description

Recall that a concept is known under two names, its _concept name_ (the file name of the concept) and its _display name_ (the name as displayed in the text).

The first two forms create a link to a concept in the current course.

The remaining two forms create a link to a concept in another course.

The first creates a link to a complete course, the second to a specific concept in an external course.


#### Examples

The concept name of this concept is `ReferenceToConcept` while its display name is `Reference to Concept` (note the spaces).

We can create a reference to the `InlineMarkup` concept in the current course in the following ways:

* `\[Inline Markup](/docs//Tutor/Markup/InlineMarkup)` (using the display name) gives [Inline Markup](/docs//Tutor/Markup/InlineMarkup).
* `\[Inline markup](/docs//Tutor/Markup/InlineMarkup)` (using its parent concept name and concept name) gives [Inline markup](/docs//Tutor/Markup/InlineMarkup).
* `\[see inline markup](/docs//Tutor/Markup/InlineMarkup)` gives [see inline markup](/docs//Tutor/Markup/InlineMarkup)

Here is a reference to another course:

* `\[If statement](/docs//Rascal/Statements/If)` gives [If statement](/docs//Rascal/Statements/If).

#### Benefits

#### Pitfalls

Note the `/` before the course name in refernces to another course.
