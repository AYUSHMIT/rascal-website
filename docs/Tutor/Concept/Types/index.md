```
#### Types

| `Exp` | `if ( Exp ) Statement;`  |
``` | 
| `bool`  |  `void`                      |



| `Exp` | `Statement~1~` | `Statement~2~` | `if ( Exp ) Statement~1~ else Statement~2~;`  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bool`  |  T~1~        | T~2~         | `lub(T~1~, T~2~)`                               |

The result will be displayed as:

#### Types

| `Exp` | `if ( Exp ) Statement;`  |
| --- | --- |
| `bool`  |  `void`                      |



| `Exp` | `Statement~1~` | `Statement~2~` | `if ( Exp ) Statement~1~ else Statement~2~;`  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bool`  |  T~1~        | T~2~         | `lub(T~1~, T~2~)`                               |
