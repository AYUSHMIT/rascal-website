#### Synopsis

Gentle introduction to the main concepts of the Rascal language.

#### Syntax

#### Types

#### Function

#### Description

Rascal is based on a dozen concepts and having a global understanding of them will help to grasp the language more quickly.
Here we will informally explain and illustrate these concepts and often we will refer to the [Rascal Language Reference](/docs//Rascal/)
for further details. In other words, we are providing here a friendly front-end for the actual language description.

Most language concepts are described separately but some features we just mention here:

*  Rascal programs consist of modules that are organized in packages.
*  Modules can import other modules.
*  The visibility of entities declared in modules can be controlled using public/private modifiers.
*  Data structures may have annotations that can be explicitly used and modified.
*  There is an extensive library for built-in datatypes, input/output, fact extraction from Java source code, visualization, and more.

Here are the concepts to be discussed:
* [Static typing](/docs//RascalConcepts/StaticTyping)
* [Datatypes](/docs//RascalConcepts/Datatypes)
* [Immutable values](/docs//RascalConcepts/ImmutableValues)
* [Enumerating](/docs//RascalConcepts/Enumerating)
* [Comprehensions](/docs//RascalConcepts/Comprehensions)
* [Pattern matching](/docs//RascalConcepts/PatternMatching)
* [Control structures](/docs//RascalConcepts/ControlStructures)
* [Case distinction](/docs//RascalConcepts/CaseDistinction)
* [Visiting](/docs//RascalConcepts/Visiting)
* [Functions](/docs//RascalConcepts/Functions)
* [Syntax definition and parsing](/docs//RascalConcepts/SyntaxDefinitionAndParsing)
* [Rewriting](/docs//RascalConcepts/Rewriting)
* [IDEConstruction](/docs//RascalConcepts/IDEConstruction)
* [Code models](/docs//RascalConcepts/CodeModels)
* [Equation solving](/docs//RascalConcepts/EquationSolving)
