#### Synopsis

Gentle introduction to the main concepts of the Rascal language.

#### Description

Rascal is based on a dozen concepts and having a global understanding of them will help to grasp the language more quickly.
Here we will informally explain and illustrate these concepts and often we will refer to the [Rascal Language Reference](../Rascal/index.md) for further details. In other words, we are providing here a friendly front-end for the actual language description.

Most language concepts are described separately but some features we just mention here:

*  Rascal programs consist of modules that are organized in packages.
*  Modules can import other modules.
*  The external visibility of entities declared in modules can be controlled using public/private modifiers.
*  Data structures may have additional keyword fields that can be explicitly used and modified.
*  There is an extensive library for built-in datatypes, input/output, fact extraction from Java source code, visualization, and more.

Here are the concepts to be discussed:
* [StaticTyping](../RascalConcepts/StaticTyping/index.md)
* [Datatypes](../RascalConcepts/Datatypes/index.md)
* [immutable values](../RascalConcepts/ImmutableValues/index.md)
* [Enumerating](../RascalConcepts/Enumerating/index.md)
* [Comprehensions](../RascalConcepts/Comprehensions/index.md)
* [pattern matching](../RascalConcepts/PatternMatching/index.md)
* [control structures](../RascalConcepts/ControlStructures/index.md)
* [case distinction](../RascalConcepts/CaseDistinction/index.md)
* [Visiting](../RascalConcepts/Visiting/index.md)
* [Functions](../RascalConcepts/Functions/index.md)
* [syntax definition and parsing](../RascalConcepts/SyntaxDefinitionAndParsing/index.md)
* [Rewriting](../RascalConcepts/Rewriting/index.md)
* [IDEConstruction](../RascalConcepts/IDEConstruction/index.md)
* [code models](../RascalConcepts/CodeModels/index.md)
* [equation solving](../RascalConcepts/EquationSolving/index.md)
