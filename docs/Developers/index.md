#### Synopsis

Contains tips, tricks and howto's on the development of Rascal itself.

#### Description

Rascal is implemented in Rascal itself and Java. It depends on many third-party
open-source libraries, and some of those are owned by the Rascal project itself.
These are [Capsule](http://github.com/usethesource/capsule) and [Vallang](http://github.com/usethesource/vallang). 

Capsule is a library for immutable collections based on the CHAMP datastructure. Vallang is the underlying run-time library for Rascal, which has all the primitive and recursively dependent data-type for storing data about software.

This manual is not complete, but it contains the following topics to help you underway to contribute bugfixes or features to Rascal:
