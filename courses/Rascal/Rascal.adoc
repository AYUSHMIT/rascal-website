.Description
What you need to know about Rascal is this:

*  Which problems can Rascal help you to solve? Check out the <<Motivation>> for Rascal and the link:{EASY}[EASY paradigm].
*  How to get started? Read <<Installing and Running>>.
*  What are the basic constructs in Rascal? Learn about its basic <<Concepts>>.
*  What is the complete reference to Rascal? Read or search through the documentation for 
   <<Rascal-Expressions,Expressions>>, <<Rascal-Statements,Statements>> or <<Rascal-Declarations,Declarations>>.
*  What standard functions does Rascal provide? Read or search through the link:{Libraries}[Rascal Libraries].


What are the key distinguishing features of Rascal?

*  <<Pattern Matching>> to express query and search in (models of) programs.
*  <<Visiting>> to traverse and transform (models of) meta programs.
*  <<Syntax Definition and Parsing>> to effectively produce parsers for programming languages and other formats.
*  <<Concrete Syntax>> to analyse and transform source code using patterns in the programming language that is manipulated.
*  Rapid <<IDE Construction>> using http://www.eclipse.org/imp/[Eclipse IMP] and other reusable aspects of meta-programming can be found
  in the link:{Libraries}[Rascal Libraries].
*  Simple value based <<Code Models>> to represent any kind of fact about source code using either hierarchical or graph-like modeling constructs.

.Examples
Read examples of Rascal code in link:{Recipes}[Recipes]. The Rascal link:{Libraries}[Rascal Libraries] contain many examples of Rascal code. 
You will also find example code on almost every page in this tutor environment.

.Benefits

*  Rascal has everything you need for any kind of meta program you want to write. See <<Motivation>>.

.Pitfalls

*  Rascal is a procedural/functional language with immutable data. Do not confuse this with object-oriented programming.
*  Rascal allows you to write highly imperative code, but it has declarative constructs that lead to shorter and more readable code.
*  Rascal execution is sometimes slow; we are working on more optimization.
*  Rascal has a static type system, but the type-checker is not yet finished; currently types are checked at run-time.
