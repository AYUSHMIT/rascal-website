.Description
The Rascal system comes in two flavours: a command line version and a version integrated in Eclipse.

At the command line the Rascal system can be invoked by typing the command *rascal*. 
Next, the Rascal prompt *rascal>* appears and you can start typing commands (declarations, statements, expressions). 
To simplify interactive use, semicolons (`;`) that end commands may be omitted at the top level.

In the Eclipse version, Rascal modules can be edited and a command console is also available.
