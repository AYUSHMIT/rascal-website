.Description

The value _V_ of _Assignable_ is determined and should be of a type that has an annotation _Name_.
A new value _V_' is created that is a copy of _V_ but with the value of annotation _Name_ replaced by the value of _Exp_.
_V_' is assigned to _Assignable_.
See <<Declarations-Annotation>>.

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>data FREQ = wf(str word, int freq);
ok
rascal>W = wf("rascal", 1000);
FREQ: wf("rascal",1000)
rascal>anno str FREQ@color;
ok
rascal>W@color = "red";
str: "red"
rascal>W@color;
str: "red"
----

NOTE: It is advisable to omit whitespace around the `@` operator,
otherwise the Rascal parser gets confused.
