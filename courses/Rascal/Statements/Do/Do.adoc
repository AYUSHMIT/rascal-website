.Types

.Function

.Description
_Statement_ is executed repeatedly, as long as the Boolean expression _Exp_ yields true. 
Expression _Exp_ is executed from scratch in each repetition and only the first true value (if any) is used.

By default, the value of a do statement is the empty list. 
In general, the value of a do statement consists of all values contributed by <<Statements-Append>> statements 
that are executed during the repeated execution of its body Statement.

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>import IO;
ok
rascal>int n = 3;
int: 3
rascal>do { println("n = <n>"); n -= 1; } while (n > 0);
n = 3
n = 2
n = 1
list[void]: []
----
Now build a list result using the `append` statement:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>n = 3;
int: 3
rascal>do { append n * n; n -= 1; } while (n > 0);
list[int]: [9,4,1]
