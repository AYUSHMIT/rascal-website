.Description
A _block_ consists of a sequence of statements separated by semi-colons.

Since a block is itself a statement, it may be used in all places where a statement is required. 
A block also introduces a new scope and variables that are declared in the block are local to that block. 
The value produced by a block is the value produced by its last statement (if any).

.Examples
Here is a contrived block of three expressions (be aware of the last semi-colon):
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>{1;2;3;}
int: 3
----
its value is `3`.

The effect of a local variable declared in a block can be seen as follows:
[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
rascal>{int x = 3; x*x;}
int: 9
----
After the block we cannot refer to `x`:
[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
rascal>x;
[error] Name x is not in scope
----
