.Description
A relation is a set of elements with the following property:

*  All elements have the same static tuple type.


Relations are thus nothing more than sets of tuples, but since they are used so often we provide a shorthand notation for them.
Relations are represented by the type `rel[_T_~1~ _L_~1~, _T_~2~ _L_~2~, ... ]`, where _T_~1~, _T_~2~, ... are arbitrary types and
_L_~1~, _L_~2~, ... are optional labels. It is a shorthand for `set[tuple[_T_~1~ _L_~1~, _T_~2~ _L_~2~, ... ]]`.

An n-ary relations with m tuples is denoted by
 `{<_E_~11~, _E_~12~, ..., _E_~1n~>,<_E_~21~, _E_~22~, ..., _E_~2n~>, ..., <_E_~m1~, _E_~m2~, ..., _E_~mn~>}`, 
where the _E_~ij~ are expressions that yield the desired element type _T_~i~.

Since relations are a form of set all operations (see <<Values-Set>>) and functions
(see <<Prelude-Set>>) are also applicable to relations.

The following additional operators are provided for relations:

The following additional functions are provided on relations:

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
{<1,10>, <2,20>, <3,30>}
----
instead of rel[int,int] we can also give `set[tuple[int,int]]` as type of the above expression
remember that these types are interchangeable.
[source,rascal-shell,continue]
----
{<"a",10>, <"b",20>, <"c",30>}
{<"a", 1, "b">, <"c", 2, "d">}
