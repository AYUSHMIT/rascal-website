.Description
A relation is a set of elements with the following property:

*  All elements have the same static tuple type.


Relations are thus nothing more than sets of tuples, but since they are used so often we provide a shorthand notation for them.
Relations are represented by the type `rel[_T_~1~ _L_~1~, _T_~2~ _L_~2~, ... ]`, where _T_~1~, _T_~2~, ... are arbitrary types and
_L_~1~, _L_~2~, ... are optional labels. It is a shorthand for `set[tuple[_T_~1~ _L_~1~, _T_~2~ _L_~2~, ... ]]`.

An n-ary relations with m tuples is denoted by
 `{< _E_~11~, _E_~12~, ..., _E_~1n~ >,< _E_~21~, _E_~22~, ..., _E_~2n~ >, ..., < _E_~m1~, _E_~m2~, ..., _E_~mn~ >}`, 
where the _E_~ij~ are expressions that yield the desired element type _T_~i~.

Since relations are a form of set all operations (see <<Values-Set>>) and functions
(see <<Prelude-Set>>) are also applicable to relations.

The following additional operators are provided for relations:


There are also link:{Libraries}#Prelude-Relation[library functions] available for Relations.


.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>{<1,10>, <2,20>, <3,30>}
rel[int,int]: {
  <1,10>,
  <2,20>,
  <3,30>
}
----
instead of `rel[int,int]` we can also give `set[tuple[int,int]]` as type of the above expression
remember that these types are interchangeable.
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>{<"a",10>, <"b",20>, <"c",30>}
rel[str,int]: {
  <"b",20>,
  <"a",10>,
  <"c",30>
}
rascal>{<"a", 1, "b">, <"c", 2, "d">}
rel[str,int,str]: {
  <"c",2,"d">,
  <"a",1,"b">
}
