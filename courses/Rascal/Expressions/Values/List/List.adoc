.Usage

.Function

.Description
A list is an ordered sequence of values and has the following properties:

*  All elements have the same static type.
*  The order of the elements matters.
*  A list may contain an element more than once.


The type of a list has the form `list[_T_]`,
where `_T_` is an arbitrary type.

When a value or variable of type list occurs inside a list, that list value is inserted as list element.
To achieve _splicing_ of these elements, i.e., the insertion of the elements of the list value rather than the whole list,
it has to be prefixed by the splice operator `*`.

The following operators are provided on list:


There are also link:{Libraries}#Prelude-List[library functions] available for List.

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>[1, 2, 3];
list[int]: [1,2,3]
rascal>[<1,10>, <2,20>, <3,30>];
lrel[int,int]: [
  <1,10>,
  <2,20>,
  <3,30>
]
rascal>[1, "b", 3];
list[value]: [1,"b",3]
rascal>[<"a",10>, <"b",20>, <"c",30>];
lrel[str,int]: [
  <"a",10>,
  <"b",20>,
  <"c",30>
]
rascal>[["a", "b"], ["c", "d", "e"]];
list[list[str]]: [
  ["a","b"],
  ["c","d","e"]
]
----
List splicing works as follows: by prefixing `L` by the splice operator, its elements are included as elements in the enclosing list:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>L = [1, 2, 3];
list[int]: [1,2,3]
rascal>[10, L, 20];
list[value]: [
  10,
  [1,2,3],
  20
]
rascal>[10, *L, 20];
list[int]: [10,1,2,3,20]
