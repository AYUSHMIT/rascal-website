#### Description

A tuple is an ordered fixed length sequence of values of possibly different type.

In Rascal a tuple is written as `<` V~1~, ..., V~n~ `>` and a tuple type has the form `type[T~1~, ..., T~n~]`,
_T_~i~ represents the type of element _i_. Tuple have two major applications:

*  As tuples in a ((Relation)).
*  For ad-hoc packaging of values, for instance, to return multiple-values from a function.


See [Tuple Values]((Rascal:Values-Tuple)) for the operations on tuples.
