The literature about Rascal goes back all the way to 1980's when its predecessor ASF+SDF spawned.
This page intends to provide a comprehensive list
of papers, PhD theses and master's theses about what is happening "under the hood", on the language
level and with the applications of Rascal in the fields of Programming Languages, Software Engineering,
Reverse Engineering, Re-engineering, Refactoring, Domain-specific Languages, Model Driven Engineering, and
Security. The list includes work by the team members working on ASF+SDF and Rascal, but also key 
inspirations from colleagues around the world..

## Applications

### 2020's

* ðŸŽ“ Lina MarÃ­a Ochoa Venegas, Break the Code? Breaking Changes and their Impact on Software Evolution, (2023) TU Eindhoven.
   > In this thesis Rascal was applied to detect breaking changes in Java libraries and predict their impact in client projects.
   > The Maracas tool reuses japicmp and the JDT M3 bridge for extracting detailed static information from source code and bytecode.
* ðŸŽ“Tim Soethout, Banking on Domain Knowledge for Faster Transactions --- Leveraging Models to Avoid Coordination, (2022) TU Eindhoven.
   > This thesis applies Rascal for Model Driven Engineering. Detailed communication protocols are generated from high-level specification.
   > The code that is generated implements algorithms that use domain knowledge to avoid locking in distributed communication systems.

* ðŸŽ“Eelco Visser,  Syntax Definition for Language Prototyping, University of Amsterdam. (1997)
   > This thesis re-designs the Syntax Definition Formalism (SDF) from scratch and removes the need for a scanner. 
   > The scannerless parsing algorithm SGLR contains the disambiguation filters required to make scannerless parsing possible and feasible.

   > Explorations of matching "modulo" theories (list matching) for more efficient term rewriting.
* ðŸŽ“Jan Rekers, Parser Generation for Interactive Environments, University of Amsterdam. (1992)
   > This thesis modifies Tomita's GLR algorithm to fix some issues but also makes it incremental and work on substrings for error recovery purposes.
