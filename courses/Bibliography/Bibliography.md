The literature about Rascal goes back all the way to 1980's when its predecessor ASF+SDF spawned.
This page intends to provide a comprehensive list
of papers, PhD theses and master's theses about what is happening "under the hood", on the language
level and with the applications of Rascal.

The bibliography is organized in batches of decades (1980's, 1990's, 2000's, 2010's, 2020's), and grouped by the following three categories:
   * Applications of Meta Programming in Compiler Construction, Language Design, Reverse Engineering, Re-engineering, Static Analysis, Typechecking, Refactoring, Source-to-source transformations, Model Driven Engineering, Model Checking, Domain Specific Languages, etc.
   * Meta Languages and Systems; their design, construction, and evaluation.
   * Data Structures and Algorithms; which are fundamental to the above.

## Applications

Work that applies the meta-technology and theories is scattered over several sub-disciplines of Computer Science; e.g.
Programming Languages, Software Engineering, Reverse Engineering, Re-engineering, Refactoring, Domain-specific Languages, Model Driven Engineering, and System Security.

   > We explore the limits of what can be learned purely from source code analysis.
   > In this thesis Rascal is used for both shallow and deep code analysis (metrics and static analysis of reflective code). By mining large open-source
   > software repositories, we discover that the cyclomatic complexity metric can _not be shown to correlate_ with source lines of code, 
   > and also we discover the destructive impact of reflection on the accuracy of static analysis tools, and what to do about that.
* Davy Landman, Alexander Serebrenik, Eric Bouwers and Jurgen J. Vinju. Empirical analysis of the relationship between CC and SLOC in a large corpus of Java methods and C functions. (2016) Journal of Software: Evolution and Process.
   > Trying extremely hard to corroborate the reports on Pearson correlation between Cyclomatic Complexity and Source Lines of Code in C functions and Java methods, we have to conclude that on a large and unbiased corpus there is only low correlation. Higher correlations reported in literature can be explained by data transformation techniques (log transform) and aggregation methods (addition over code modules). **SLOC DOES NOT CORRELATE LINEARLY TO CC ACCORDING TO OUR RESULTS**

   > This is a comprehensive overview of the first release of Rascal as it was used in education at the Master Software Engineering for the first time in 
   > 2009, and at the summer school in Braga that year. Note that the language has evolved quite a bit since then, so as a manual it is not apropriate anymore. 
   > The paper shows how the transformation and analysis paradigms have been merged into a single meta-language. You can find elements of ASF, SDF, Box, ATerms, 
   > ApiGen, RScript, and other design elements in this paper. This paper is often cited as the origin paper for Rascal. The other origin paper was in IEEE SCAM 2009 (see below).

   > to Eclipse IMP within a few weeks. Later the Rascal Eclipse environment was also built directly on top of IMP. Others also had benefit from IMP, like the Eclipse-based environment for the X10 language, the Spoofax lanuage workbench and the Hege language.

   > in this paper was later the inspiration for much of the SDF notation. The move towards algebraic specification later during the ESPRIT GIPE projects focused the pattern
   > matching on trees instead of strings. String matching came back in Rascal later only in 2009.
   
## Algorithms and Data-structures

Here we find the algorithms and data-structures that enable the meta languages to work, to 
be efficient and scalable or generalizable. Sometimes the tools are intrically linked to the meta-language's designs; we list those
contributions here rather than above.
