The literature about Rascal goes back all the way to 1980's when its predecessor ASF+SDF spawned.
This page intends to provide a comprehensive list
of papers, PhD theses and master's theses about what is happening "under the hood", on the language
level and with the applications of Rascal in the fields of Programming Languages, Software Engineering,
Reverse Engineering, Re-engineering, Refactoring, Domain-specific Languages, Model Driven Engineering, and
Security. The list includes work by the team members working on ASF+SDF and Rascal, but also key 
inspirations from colleagues around the world..
