title: Syntax Definition and Parsing

#### Synopsis

Syntax definition and parser generation for new languages.

#### Description

All source code analysis projects need to extract information directly from the source code. 
There are two main approaches to this:

*  _Lexical information_: Use regular expressions to extract useful, but somewhat superficial, flat, information. 
   This can be achieved using regular expression patterns, 
   see [Regular Expression Pattern]((Rascal:Patterns-Regular))s.
*  _Structured information_: Use syntax analysis to extract the complete, nested, structure of the source code 
   in the form of a syntax tree. Rascal can directly manipulate the parse trees, but it also enables user-defined
   mappings from parse tree to abstract syntax tree.


Using [Syntax Definitions]((Rascal:Declarations-SyntaxDefinition)) you can define the syntax of any (programming) language. Then Rascal:

*  will generate the parser, and
*  will provide pattern matching and pattern construction on parse trees and abstract syntax trees,
   see [Abstract Patterns]((Rascal:Patterns-Node)) and    
  [Concrete Patterns]((Rascal:Patterns-Concrete)).

#### Examples

Let's use the Exp language as example. It contains the following elements:

*  Integer constants, e.g., `123`.
*  A multiplication operator, e.g., `3*4`.
*  An addition operator, e.g., `3+4`.
*  Multiplication is left-associative and has precedence over addition.
*  Addition is left-associative.
*  Parentheses can be used to override the precedence of the operators.

Here are some examples:

*  `123`
*  `2+3+4`
*  `2+3*4`
*  `(2+3)*4`


The EXP language can be defined as follows:

```rascal-commands
lexical IntegerLiteral = [0-9]+; 

start syntax Exp        
  = IntegerLiteral      
  | bracket "(" Exp ")" 
  > left Exp "*" Exp    
  > left Exp "+" Exp    
  ;

layout Whitespace
    = [\ \t\n]*;
```

                
Now you may parse and manipulate programs in the EXP language. Let's demonstrate parsing an expression:
```rascal-shell,continue
import ParseTree;
parse(#start[Exp], "2+3*4");
t = [Exp] "1+2*3";
import vis::Text;
import IO;
println(prettyTree(t))
```

First we import the syntax definition and the link:/Libraries/Prelude-ParseTree[ParseTree] module that provides the parsing functionality.
Finally, we parse `2+3*4` using the start symbol `Exp`.

The points we want to make are:
*  Rascal grammars are relatively easy to read and write (unfortunately, writing grammars will never become simple).
*  Parser generation is completely implicit.
*  Given a syntax definition, it can be used immediately for parsing.

[EXP]((Recipes:Languages-Exp))
language and [Languages]((Recipes:Recipes-Languages)) for other language examples.
