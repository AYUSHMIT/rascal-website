#### Synopsis

Gentle introduction to the main concepts of the Rascal language.

#### Syntax

#### Function

#### Description

Rascal is based on a dozen concepts and having a global understanding of them will help to grasp the language more quickly.
Here we will informally explain and illustrate these concepts and often we will refer to the [Rascal Language Reference]((Rascal)) for further details. In other words, we are providing here a friendly front-end for the actual language description.

Most language concepts are described separately but some features we just mention here:

*  Rascal programs consist of modules that are organized in packages.
*  Modules can import other modules.
*  The external visibility of entities declared in modules can be controlled using public/private modifiers.
*  Data structures may have additional keyword fields that can be explicitly used and modified.
*  There is an extensive library for built-in datatypes, input/output, fact extraction from Java source code, visualization, and more.

Here are the concepts to be discussed:
