title: Create a new Rascal project

```rascal-prepare
import IO;
remove(|tmp:///myProjectName|, recursive=true);
```

Rascal projects, generally, work the same in all three IDE contexts:
* Eclipse
* VScode
* Commandline

To create an empty project to get started, follow these instructions:

* [Run a rascal REPL]((RunningRascal))
* Then use the ((newRascalProject)) library utility function:
```rascal-shell
import util::Reflective;
newRascalProject(|tmp:///myProjectName|, name="myProjectName")
```

The Eclipse plugin has a "New Project Wizard" you can use as well.

The next step is to import the new project into VScode or Eclipse, or
to `cd` to the project's root directory. From there on ((RunningRascal))
with the new project's source and library settings is trivial.

## Rascal Project Layout

Let's describe the anatomy of what is generated by ((newRascalProject)), in case you
need to reproduce it manually for some reason. 

```rascal-shell
import util::FileSystem;
// there are these files in the newly create project
[ l | /file(l) := crawl(|tmp:///myProjectName|) ]
```

The `pom.xml` file is the basic setup that names the project and defines its dependencies. It defines:
* project name (artifactId and groupId)
* project version
* where to find Rascal library packages (repositories)
* where to find Rascal maven plugins (pluginRepositories)
* a list of dependencies (by default only Rascal, but find more packages
* minimal configurations for the required maven plugins (Java and Rascal)

```xml
((|tmp:///myProjectName/pom.xml|))
```

Next to that `RASCAL.MF` is required to configure the development environment for the project. Some
information from the `pom.xml` is repeated here, because this file is common between Eclipse, VScode and empty commandline projects,
and such projects could work with a `pom.xml`:

```MF
((|tmp:///myProjectName/META-INF/RASCAL.MF|))
```

And finally in `src/main/rascal` you'll find the Rascal source files, as configured in `RASCAL.MF`. In this case it's only `Main.rsc`:

```rascal
((|tmp:///myProjectName/src/main/rascal/Main.rsc|))
```
