#### Synopsis

Convert a Pico parse tree into a Pico abstract syntax tree.

#### Description

#### Examples

The mapping between parse tree and abstract sybtax tree is achieved as follows:
```rascal-include
demo::lang::Pico::Load
```

                
Notes:

<1>  The function `load` takes a string as argument (supposedly the source code of a Pico program) and returns a value of type `PROGRAM`,
the abstract syntax tree of the input program. In case the input program is syntactically incorrect, a `ParseError` exception will be thrown,
see [RuntimeException]((Library:module:Exception)).

<2>  `parse(#start[Program], txt)`: parse `txt` according to the non-terminal `Program`.
   * Note that `#start[Program]` is a _reified type_. The `#` operator turns a type literal into an ordinary Rascal value, whiich is then used by the `parse` function to generate a parser.
   * We use `#start[Program]` instead of directly `#Program` because the automatic `start` rule accepts whitespace before and after the program. See [reified types]((Rascal:Values-ReifiedTypes)) for more information about reifying types and grammars.
   & The `parse` function returns a ((Rascalopedia:ParseTree)) of the input program.

<3>  `implode(#PROGRAM, parse(#Program, txt))`: transform the parse returned by `parse` into an abstract syntax tree of type `PROGRAM`. The ((Library:ParseTree-implode)) function performs the automatic mapping between elements in the parse tree and their counterpart in the abstract syntax.


The function `load` can be used as follows:
```rascal-shell
import demo::lang::Pico::Load;
load("begin declare x : natural; x := 3 end");
```

Observe how the various parts of the abstract syntax tree are annotated with location attributes.
