Rascal is a programming languages geared towards language processing:
* the backbone is procedural/functional programming with immutable data
* abstract and concrete grammars define parsers and hierarchical data-types
* relations and relational calculus provide database/logic query functionality

Here we briefly introduce the most relevant skills by example:

The [reference manual]((course:Rascal)) spells out all syntax and semantics organized per language feature.
