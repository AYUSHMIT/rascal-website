## UseTheSource Community
UseTheSource is a collection of open-source projects related to [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) in a broad sense and [software language engineering](http://www.sleconf.org/): languages, libraries, tools, IDEs. See [Projects](https://usethesource.io/projects/) for the full list. The general goal of this software is to help software engineers manage the complexity of their code by automating tasks which are hard or cumbersome to do otherwise. On UseTheSource code means everything: *abstract models*, *specifications*, *data files* and *source code* -as written in any given software language.
